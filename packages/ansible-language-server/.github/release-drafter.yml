# We append `-next.0` to our drafted tags because we do not want to make a
# full release when we press "publish" on github releases.
#
# npm version prerelease --preid=next
#
# In our release pipeline we will create a pull-request that updates
# docs/changelog.md and the version number.
#
# When this pull request is merged, we will:
# * publish to npm
# * create the correct tag (already present in package.json)
# * edit the release to point it the new tag instead of the -next.0 one
tag-template: 'v$RESOLVED_VERSION'
# instead of 2x# we use 3x to make the outcome ready to embed into docs/changelog.md
