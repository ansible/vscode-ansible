# Contributing

To contribute, you'll need to:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a branch and push your changes there.

3. Install and run [task] and ensure it does pass.

4. Send it to us as a PR.

5. Iterate on your PR, incorporating the requested improvements and
   participating in the discussions.

**_NOTE:_** On some operating systems, `task` may be another command, such as
`go-task`.

## Contributing docs

To build the documentation locally run `task docs`.

It is also integrated with [Read The Docs][rtd] that builds and publishes each
commit to the main branch and generates live docs previews for each pull
request.
