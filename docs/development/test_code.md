# Test code

1. general idea - test fixtures, test files
2. test code for extension: ui, unit, e2e
3. test code for language server
4. scripts to run the tests

Tests for the extension and the language server are stored separately in their respective directories inside the `test` sub-folders.

Throughout the project and for all types of tests, we have:

1. Test fixtures: Settings and Ansible files against which the tests are run.
2. Test scripts: the actual test code.

## Extension tests

There are three types of tests for the extension:

1. Unit tests: Check various functions used across the extension.
2. End-to-end (e2e) tests: Test the entire user flow. They open a test host of the extension, run the whole workflow from launching the extension, loading Ansible files in the editor, activating the language server, using the language features, and finally asserting the outcome.
3. UI tests: Check the presence and functionality of various UI elements in the VS Code interface, from the status bar and activity bar to web-views and terminal views.

## Language server tests

The language server has only unit tests in its directory, as the end-to-end testing is already covered by the extension's e2e tests. A test file for each provider (language feature) is present, that tests the functionality of the language feature.

## Running the Tests

Each type of test has its own script and can be run by `yarn run <script-name>`:

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Always run `yarn run compile` before running the tests.

1. unit-tests: Runs the unit tests for the extension.

For the following tests (UI tests for the extension), you need to package and build a `.vsix file` of the extension by running `yarn run package`. As you run the UI tests, the .vsix file is automatically installed and the UI elements are checked.

2. test-ui-current: Runs the UI tests on the latest version of VS Code.
3. test-ui-oldest: Runs the UI tests on the oldest supported version of VS Code.
4. test-e2e: Runs the end-to-end tests for the extension.

For the following tests (tests for the language server), navigate to the root of the `ansible-language-server` directory and then run the script:

5. test-with-ee: Runs the language server unit tests in an execution environment.
6. test-without-ee: Runs the language server unit tests in a normal environment.
7. test: Runs the language server unit tests in both the environments one after the other.
