# Ansible VS Code Extension

The Ansible extension for Visual Studio Code streamlines Ansible development by
providing an integrated, feature-rich environment tailored for automation
workflows. It offers features such as syntax highlighting, linting, intelligent
code completion, and AI-assisted suggestions via Ansible Lightspeed.

With support for multi-root workspaces, containerized execution environments,
and extensive configuration options, the extension enhances productivity and
ensures consistent code quality for both individual and team-based projects.
This extension adds language support for Ansible in
[Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible)
and [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/redhat/ansible) by using the
[ansible-language-server](als/README.md).

## Installation Requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system has:

- The [`ansible-dev-tools`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-dev-tools) python
  package
- A supported version of
  [`ansible-core`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html)
- Optionally, a `devcontainer.yaml` file to develop in a devcontainer
  eliminating the need to install and manage python versions and packages.

> Note: On Windows, use with the Remote - WSL or Remote - Containers extensions
> for optimal compatibility.

## Manual Extension Activation

It is recommended to open a folder containing Ansible files with a VS Code
workspace.

![Linter support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ansible/vscode-ansible/images/activate-extension.gif)

Note:

- For Ansible files open in an editor window ensure the language mode is set to
  `Ansible` (bottom right of VS Code window).
- The runtime status of extension should be in activate state. It can be
  verified in the `Extension` window `Runtime Status` tab for `Ansible`
  extension.

## Getting Started

### Welcome Page

The extension provides a comprehensive Welcome Page that serves as a dashboard
for Ansible development tools. Access it as follows:

- Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
- Type "Open Ansible Development Tools menu" and selecting it.

  **OR**

- From the Quick Links panel, click **Getting Started**.

  - The walkthroughs will appear on the right-hand side.

### Interactive Walkthroughs

The extension offers guided walkthroughs to help you quickly get started with
Ansible development using step-by-step instructions.

#### Create an Ansible Environment

Learn how to create a new Ansible playbook, configure the environment using the
status bar, and install the necessary Ansible packages to get set up.

#### Start Automating with Your First Ansible Playbook

This walkthrough guides you through enabling Ansible Lightspeed, creating a
playbook project, writing your first playbook, and saving it within the project
structure.

## Using Dev Containers

This extension supports generating dev containers to provide isolated,
consistent Ansible development environments in VS Code. The
[Microsoft Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
is required for this feature. See the
[Ansible Development Tools (ADT)- Execution Environment documentation](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/dev-tools/container/)
for more information on what is included in the generated dev container.

### Create a dev container

Quick Links Panel: Go to Ansible sidebar → click dev container

Command Palette: Ctrl+Shift+P → search "Ansible: Create a dev container"

### Configuration Options

Choose image:

- Upstream: ghcr.io/ansible/community-ansible-dev-tools:latest

- Downstream: registry.redhat.io/.../ansible-dev-tools-rhel8:latest

Set destination and overwrite options in the webview, and click "Create".

### Open workspace in the dev container

Command Palette: Ctrl+Shift+P → search "Dev Containers: Reopen in container"

Select the dev container file that matches your desired container engine.

The workspace will reopen in a container with all the Ansible Development Tools
(ADT) installed.

## Ansible Lightspeed

The extension integrates with Ansible Lightspeed with watsonx Code Assistant to
provide AI-powered features. Lightspeed provides inline code suggestions as you
type:

- Press Ctrl+. to trigger suggestions
- Press Tab to accept a suggestion
- Press Escape to hide a suggestion

See the
[Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed setup guide](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/set-up-lightspeed_lightspeed-user-guide#set-up-lightspeed_lightspeed-user-guide)
to get started.

## Content Creation Tools

The extension provides webview-based interfaces for creating and scaffolding
Ansible content.

### Creating Collections

You can create a new Ansible collection with a structured layout including:

- Basic collection metadata
- Directory structure for plugins, modules, and roles
- Documentation templates
- Test framework setup

To create a collection:

- Click "Collection project" in the Quick Links panel
- Enter the namespace and collection name
- Specify the destination directory
- Click "Create"

### Creating Playbooks

The extension offers multiple ways to create playbooks:

### Empty Playbook

- Use the command "Ansible: Create an empty Ansible playbook"
- Edit the playbook manually

### AI-Generated Playbook (with Ansible Lightspeed)

- Use the command "Ansible Lightspeed: Playbook generation "
- Describe what you want the playbook to do
- Review and customize the generated playbook

### Playbook Project

- Use the command "Ansible: Create New Playbook Project"
- Enter the namespace and collection name
- Specify the destination directory

A complete project structure will be created with playbooks, inventory, and
configuration files

### Creating Execution Environments

You can create execution environment configurations for containerized Ansible
environments:

1. Click "Execution environment project" in the Quick Links panel

2. Configure: Base image, Collections to include, System packages, Python
   packages

3. Click "Create" to generate the execution environment file

## Ansible Language Files

The extension works when a document is assigned the Ansible language. Files are
automatically recognized as 'Ansible' in these cases:

### Without file inspection

- yaml files under `/playbooks` dir.
- files with the following double extension: `.ansible.yml` or `.ansible.yaml`.
- notable yaml names recognized by ansible like `site.yml` or `site.yaml`
- yaml files having playbook in their filename: `*playbook*.yml` or
  `*playbook*.yaml`

Additionally, in VS Code, you can add persistent file association for language
to `settings.json` file like this:

```json
{
  ...

  "files.associations": {
    "*plays.yml": "ansible",
    "*init.yml": "yaml",
  }
}
```

### File inspection for Ansible keywords

- Primary method is inspection for top level playbook keywords like 'hosts',
  'import_playbook' and 'ansible.builtin.import_playbook' in yaml files.

### Modelines (optional)

- The extension also supports the usage of
  [modelines](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Modeline_magic) and when used, it is
  given highest priority and language is set according to modelines. Example and
  syntax of modelines:

```yaml
# code: language=ansible
or
# code: language=yaml
```

Rest all the .yml, or .yaml files will remain yaml by default unless the user
explicitly changes the language to ansible for which the process is mentioned
below.

## Ansible Language Features

### Syntax highlighting

The extension provides distinct highlighting for:

- Ansible keywords
- Module names and options
- YAML elements
- Jinja expressions (even in conditionals like when, failed_when, etc.)

![Syntax highlighting](images/syntax-highlighting.png)

> The screenshots and animations presented in this README have been taken using
> the One Dark Pro theme. The default VS Code theme will not show the syntax
> elements as distinctly, unless customized. Virtually any theme other than
> default will do better.

### Validation

![YAML validation](images/yaml-validation.gif)

While you type, the syntax of your Ansible scripts is verified and any feedback
is provided instantaneously.

### Integration with ansible-lint

![Linter support](images/ansible-lint.gif)

On opening and saving a document, `ansible-lint` is executed in the background
and any findings are presented as errors. You might find it useful that
rules/tags added to `warn_list` (see
[Ansible Lint Documentation](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/configuring/))
are shown as warnings instead.

### Smart autocompletion

![Autocompletion](images/smart-completions.gif)

The extension tries to detect whether the cursor is on a play, block or task
etc. and provides suggestions accordingly. There are also a few other rules that
improve user experience:

- the `name` property is always suggested first
- on module options, the required properties are shown first, and aliases are
  shown last, otherwise ordering from the documentation is preserved
- FQCNs (fully qualified collection names) are inserted only when necessary;
  collections configured with the
  [`collections` keyword](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections_guide/index.html#simplifying-module-names-with-the-collections-keyword)
  are honored. This behavior can be disabled in extension settings.

### Auto-closing Jinja expressions

![Easier Jinja expression typing](images/jinja-expression.gif)

When writing a Jinja expression, you only need to type `"{{`, and it will be
mirrored behind the cursor (including the space). You can also select the whole
expression and press `space` to put spaces on both sides of the expression.

### Documentation reference

![Documentation on hover](images/hover-documentation-module.png)

Documentation is available on hover for Ansible keywords, modules and module
options. The extension works on the same principle as `ansible-doc`, providing
the documentation straight from the Python implementation of the modules.

### Jump to module code

![Go to code on Ctrl+click](images/go-to-definition.gif)

You may also open the implementation of any module using the standard _Go to
Definition_ operation, for instance, by clicking on the module name while
holding `ctrl`/`cmd`.

## Data and Telemetry

The `vscode-ansible` extension collects anonymous [usage data](usage-data.md)
and sends it to Red Hat servers to help improve our products and services. Read
our
[privacy statement](https://developers.redhat.com/article/tool-data-collection)
to learn more. This extension respects the `redhat.telemetry.enabled` setting,
which you can learn more about at
<https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-redhat-telemetry#how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting>.

## Known limitations

- The shorthand syntax for module options (key=value pairs) is not supported.
- Nested module options are not supported yet.
- Only Jinja expressions inside Ansible YAML files are supported. To enable
  syntax highlighting for Jinja template files (e.g., .j2), you can install the
  [Better Jinja extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samuelcolvin.jinjahtml).
- Full support for Jinja blocks (e.g., {% for %}, {% if %}) within Ansible YAML
  files, such as advanced syntax highlighting or autocompletion specific to
  block structures, is not yet implemented. Basic YAML highlighting will apply
  within these blocks.
