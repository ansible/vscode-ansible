# Why PR Comment Trigger Isn't Working (Yet)

## The Problem

The `pr-comment-trigger.yml` workflow **does NOT exist in the `main` branch yet**, only in your feature branch.

**GitHub Security Rule:** Workflows from PR branches won't run unless they already exist in the base branch (main). This prevents malicious code in PRs from executing with repository privileges.

## Current Situation

```
main branch:
  .github/workflows/
    ‚úÖ ci.yaml (exists)
    ‚ùå pr-comment-trigger.yml (MISSING!)

your PR branch:
  .github/workflows/
    ‚úÖ ci.yaml (modified)
    ‚úÖ pr-comment-trigger.yml (NEW! - but can't run yet)
```

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Merge First (Recommended) ‚úÖ

1. **Merge PR #2227 to main**
2. **Create a new test PR** (any small change)
3. **Comment `/test`** on the new PR
4. **It will work!** üéâ

After merging, the workflow will work on ALL future PRs.

### Option 2: Test Manually NOW (No Merge Needed) üß™

You can test the `workflow_dispatch` functionality right now:

#### Via GitHub UI

1. Go to: <https://github.com/ansible/vscode-ansible/actions>
2. Click "**ci**" in the left sidebar
3. Click "**Run workflow**" (green button, top right)
4. Select branch: `testing-branch-for-comment`
5. Choose test_type: `all`
6. Click "**Run workflow**"

#### Via Command Line

```bash
# Make sure gh CLI is authenticated
gh auth login

# Trigger the workflow
gh workflow run ci.yaml \
    --ref testing-branch-for-comment \
    -f test_type="all" \
    -f triggered_by="manual_test"

# Watch it run
gh run watch
```

This proves that the modifications to `ci.yaml` work correctly!

## What Happens After Merge

Once merged to main:

```bash
# On ANY future PR, you can comment:
/test              # Run all tests
/test-unit         # Run unit tests only
/test-ui           # Run UI tests only
/test-e2e          # Run E2E tests only
/test-als          # Run ALS tests only
run all tests      # Natural language version
```

The bot will:

1. ‚úÖ Respond with confirmation
2. ‚úÖ Post a link to the running tests
3. ‚úÖ Post final results (pass/fail)

## Why This Security Rule Exists

GitHub prevents PR workflows from running to protect against:

- Malicious code accessing repository secrets
- Unauthorized actions in PRs from forks
- Security vulnerabilities from untrusted code

Only workflows in the base branch (main) are trusted to run on PR events.

## Verification

You can verify the workflow file exists in main after merging:

```bash
# Check if workflow exists in main
git ls-tree origin/main:.github/workflows/ | grep pr-comment

# After merge, you should see:
# pr-comment-trigger.yml
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Review PR #2227
2. ‚úÖ Merge to main
3. ‚úÖ Create a test PR
4. ‚úÖ Comment `/test`
5. üéâ Celebrate automated testing!
